# Skilltree backend application

> Main backend application to service the business needs of the Skilltree learning tool

This repository contains the codebase that powers the Skilltree learning tool for students. It's currently in development as part of a group challenge of Fontys Hogeschool HBO-ICT OvP. This application is not the outcome of the group, but rather an experiment of Cyril to gain experience of Domain Driven Design (DDD) within the Laravel PHP framework technology stack.
